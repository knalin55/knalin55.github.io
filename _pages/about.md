Hey! I'm Nalin, a student at NISER, Bhubaneswar, pursuing Integrated MSc degree (Batch 2016-21) with major's in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science. 
I've worked on projects in Computer Vision, NLP and parametric & non-parametric Regression. 

Recently, I got an opportunity to work with TATA Steels where I worked on a project on automation of document verification. In addition to that, I also worked on computer vision (Detection and counting of steel reinforcement bars) and text analytics (Dealers' name matching so as to increase the sales) problem.
